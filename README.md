# Allison's DroneDeploy Exercise

### Tech stack
- **Programming language**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Project environment**: GitHub

## The Goal

- The goal of this exercise was to create a functioning web application the utilized AI to allow a user to chat with an AI bot to receive information relevant to provided data. 
 
### Using the Application

1. Because this app runs locally, you will need to fork this repo and launch on your machine.
2. User can submit a question by typing a question in the input and clicking `Send`.
3. The user will see their inquery appear above the input.
4. The bot will provide a response or throw an error.

### Key Takeaways + Retro

- I wanted to focus on backend functionality for this project and wanted to use the best framework and AI integration. In hindsight, I spent too long deciding which framework to use. Picking a framework I was more comfortable with from the start would have saved me time and energy.
- Due to Open AI rate permissions, I was unable to get past the `POST 429` error. The bot then throws an error message, saying it is having trouble, and prompts the user to try again. I referenced Open AI documentation, Vite + React documentation, and various forms of AI to overcome the bug, incorporated testing in my code, but was unsuccessful.
- While I'm not 100% satisfied with my end product, I was determined to submit what I had before the deadline.

### Future Plans

- Get the backend working properly by gaining a better understanding of the Open AI API.
- Enhance accessibility through styling, error-handling, and deployment.

### Thank You

- Thank you for the opportunity! I enjoyed this exercise and learned so much about building bots, navigating a new-to-me API, and keeping at my React + Vite skills.
